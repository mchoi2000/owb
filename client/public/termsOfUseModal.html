                <li>The Marketplace will route 100% of the revenue from sales of your Offering/s to the IBM ledger as green dollar revenue.  For IBM invoicing, ledger processing and revenue scoring occurs at the time the client is invoiced.  For credit card processing, revenue and customer payments will be processed to the ledger no later than the end of the month of the invoice date. Revenue routing is handled by IBM Finance, with ledger feeds starting the third week of every month (opens around the 13th day, but can vary a little due to weekends and holidays) thru the end of the month. </li>
                <li>For credit card processing, there is a Marketplace processing fee of $0.05 per individual transaction and a ~ 3% credit card processing fee for each credit card payment amount. The Marketplace will cover these costs</li>
                <li>You need to provide the Marketplace finance/revenue routing codes for your business unit and Offering/s. These finance/revenue routing codes will apply to all Offerings that are published under this qualification and will be linked to your Marketplace Account.  If there are multiple Offerings that require different finance revenue routing codes, these can either be distinguished and listed individually by Product ID, or submit under separate qualifications for separate Marketplace Accounts for those other Offerings  </li>
